## Objective
In the current scenario, there is a widespread of coronavirus in the entire world, but there are limited supplies and services for the patients. There is a fear in the atmosphere regarding mass spread of deadly disease. To counter the problem, we created a project that aims at demonstrating live stats country-wise as well as city wise in some cases. 
To take another step towards challenges, we have also introduced prediction rate, where, one can easily predict recovery rate and prediction rate for any day in future.


## Services Offered:

1. **Live Covid 19 Stats** - People can monitor the live stats of Coronavirus Confirmed, Active, Recovered cases, etc. in one place.

2. **Prediction rate** - To ease the situation, one can easily predict recovery rate as well as infected rate for future course of time.

3. **Real-Time Self Assessment Chatbot** - People can do take their self-assessment checkup by answering the few questions and based on that answers, the user will get the advice by the chatbot such as to quarantine or visit the hospital or precautions if the user is healthy. This will help people in ensuring their safety.
